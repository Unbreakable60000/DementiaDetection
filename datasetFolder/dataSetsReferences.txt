NOT currently using this dataset, has good features but doesn't have much to have the user input with:

The below is The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset is a large, 
de‑identified health record database from ICU patients in Boston, USA.
@article{PhysioNet-mimiciv-3.1,
  author = {Johnson, Alistair and Bulgarelli, Lucas and Pollard, Tom and Gow, Brian and Moody, Benjamin and Horng, Steven and Celi, Leo Anthony and Mark, Roger},
  title = {{MIMIC-IV}},
  journal = {{PhysioNet}},
  year = {2024},
  month = oct,
  note = {Version 3.1},
  doi = {10.13026/kpb9-mt58},
  url = {https://doi.org/10.13026/kpb9-mt58}
}
Content: De‑identified ICU patient records with vital signs, lab results, 
treatment details, diagnoses (ICD codes), demographics, and more.
- contains no cognitive tests which is good
- Access: Free after completing a short online 
training and data use agreement through PhysioNet (much faster than UK Biobank).

^similar the one above but larger and across more hospitals (eICU‑CRD) and requires training course
hosted on PhysioNet, the same platform as MIMIC‑IV.

Problem with MIMIC is that it is one hospital,eICU‑CRD is multiple. 

I want one with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) with preferably more than dementia so I can have 
dementia 1 and non as 0 

Complexity has become an issue, I must simplify if I want to get to the goal, this means using and adapting 
less complex datasets as gaining access to larger datasets is very difficult

-------------------------

Trying this one below for the coding as I believe it can be changed and altered for my needs (showns previously)
